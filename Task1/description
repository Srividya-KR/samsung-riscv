The task involves installing the RISC-V toolchain using the VDI link by following the steps outlined in the shared PDF and compiling a simple C program as demonstrated in the lab video. It also includes setting up a GitHub repository named samsung-riscv, installing the necessary toolchain, and completing hands-on exercises based on the provided lab videos. The objective is to help us become familiar with the RISC-V architecture, its toolchain, and the execution of programs written in C and RISC-V.
