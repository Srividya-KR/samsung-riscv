 It involves showcasing debugging and disassembly of a RISC-V program named palindrome.o using the spike simulator. The first two images show the execution and register state at specific program counters (pc) with commands like until pc 0 100b0. The last image displays the disassembled .text section, highlighting instructions such as lui, addi, sd, and calls to functions like printf and scanf.We run the debugger with until pc 0 100b4, pausing at a specific program counter. The addi instruction is executed, modifying the stack pointer (sp). The register values are inspected using commands like reg.
