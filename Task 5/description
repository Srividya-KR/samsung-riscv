This project involves the implementation of a Binary-to-Gray Code Converter using the VSD Squadron Mini, a RISC-V-based SoC development kit. A Binary-to-Gray converter is essential in digital systems, particularly in error correction, digital communication, and encoder applications. This project showcases the practical application of digital logic and RISC-V architecture by converting binary numbers into their corresponding Gray code representations.

The implementation includes reading binary input through GPIO pins, designing the Binary-to-Gray conversion logic, simulating the design using the PlatformIO IDE This project provides a hands-on understanding of RISC-V for custom hardware-based applications.
