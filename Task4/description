Using the RISC-V Core Verilog netlist and Testbench, conduct a Functional Simulation experiment with GTKWave to analyze the waveforms.

Steps:

Install iverilog and GTKWave on Ubuntu using the appropriate commands.
Compile the RISC-V Core Verilog netlist and Testbench.
View and analyze the waveform output in the GTKWave window.
